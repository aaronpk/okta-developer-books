<p>Authentication is the process of proving who you are. In the real world, you authenticate every day. You show your driver's license when you use your credit card, you show your passport when you embark on an international flight, and you show your driver’s license when you get pulled over by a police officer. In the real world, the driver’s license and passport serve as proof of your identity.</p>

<p>On the internet, you’re accustomed to proving who you are by typing in a username and password. In this way, your credentials are like your driver’s license. They verify you.</p>

<p>APIs are different from web applications in that they rarely have a <em>face</em>. They’re often just buckets of data that get their information exposed via API calls, also known as HTTP requests. APIs are for programmers and applications; they're rarely exposed to end users. As a result, programmers have more but options for authentication but they all have tradeoffs.</p>

<p>HTTP-based APIs are the most common, so let’s begin by talking about some options built into the protocol.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All authentication options described in this chapter <strong>must</strong> all happen over an HTTPS (TLS) connection to be secure.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="authn-api-authentication-options">API Authentication Options</h2>

<p>The first type of API authentication I’ll talk about is HTTP Basic Authentication.</p>

<p>HTTP Basic Authentication is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617">RFC 7617</a>. This document was created in September 2015 by the internet standards body known as The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It replaces <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617">RFC 2617</a>, which was created in 1999 and defined both basic and digest authentication.</p>

<p>Basic authentication is the simplest form of web authentication. It's a stateless protocol that doesn't require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages (like most other forms of web authentication today).</p>

<h3>HTTP Basic Authentication</h3>

<p>Basic authentication works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>When a client sends a request to the server, the server returns a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response status and provides information on how to authenticate with a <code style="word-break: keep-all">WWW-Authenticate</code> response header.</li>
<li>If the client is a browser, a built-in browser dialog will prompt the user for a username and password. A programmer has no control over what this dialog looks like.</li>
<li>When a browser sends the user’s credentials to the server, the username and password are combined with a colon separator (<code>username:password</code>), base64-encoded, then added to the <code>Authorization</code> header like so:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
</code></pre>

<p>The server will receive this request, decode the authorization header, split on the colon, and use the credentials to validate the user has access to perform the operation.</p>

<p>When using HTTP Basic Authentication to secure APIs, its recommended the username and password be long, random strings rather than easy-to-remember names. Entropy means a “lack of order and predictability” and is very important for passwords, especially if you’re generating them. The more random your password generation process is, the better. One important aspect is that the API username and password must not be the same username and password as the account’s username and password. Not only are their security implications of using the same credentials but something as simple as clicking “forgot password” can knock your applications offline.</p>

<p>While basic auth is perfectly fine to use, one of its issues is that your username+password are sent over the network on every request. This increases the likelihood that they could be leaked, logged, or reused in other applications.</p>

<p>Basic authentication has other long term issues as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Key rotation</strong> - What happens if you have an app running with basic authentication in production and you accidentally publish your API key on GitHub? As an API provider, you need a strategy for supporting multiple keys so your users can rotate them without downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Delegation</strong> - If you're building an API that needs to run for a third party (like a Google API for grabbing someone's friends), you don't want to use Basic because it would require a username/password to be given to your app from a user. If this is the account username, there is no delegation or scoping of permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Browsers</strong> - If your API needs to be consumed from an insecure environment (JavaScript front end, mobile app, etc.), you can't just embed an API key in your app, otherwise attackers would grab it and do bad things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several authentication schemes use the HTTP authentication framework. Schemes can differ in security strength and their availability in client or server software. All schemes use an <code>Authorization</code> header followed by scheme name and a space character. Common <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Authentication_schemes">scheme names</a> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Digest</li>
<li>Bearer (for OAuth 2.0)</li>
<li>HOBA (HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication, RFC 7486, draft)</li>
<li>Mutual (Mutual Authentication Protocol, draft)</li>
<li>Signature (HTTP Signatures and AWS4-HMAC-SHA256)</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic authentication is easy to implement for APIs, but it’s not often used in web applications because the login form can’t be customized and “logging out” requires closing the browser.</p>

<h2 id="authn-federated">Federated Identity</h2>

<p>Federated identity is a way to use an account from one website to create an account and log in to a different site.</p>

<p>There are two main players in a federated identity system: an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP). Often, the service provider is the application that you need to log in to, and the IdP is the provider of the users that can log in.</p>

<figure id="fig_authn_federated_identity">
  <img src="images/federated-identity.png" alt="" style="width: 75%"/>
  <figcaption>Federated Identity</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="authn-oauth-2">OAuth 2.0</h3>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework which is ideal for APIs. It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user’s data without giving away a user’s password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities. It supports server-to-server apps, browser-based apps, mobile/native apps, and consoles/TVs.</p>

<aside class="aside">

<p>It’s worth remembering that although there are two things called OAuth - OAuth 1.0a (RFC 5849) and OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749) - these specifications are <em>completely different</em> from one another and cannot be used together; there is <strong>no</strong> backward compatibility between them. Whenever we say OAuth here, assume we mean OAuth 2.0.</p>

</aside>

<p>OAuth is like a hotel key card, but for apps. If you have a hotel key card, you can get access to your room, the business center, and potentially the gym. How do you get a hotel key card? You have to do an authentication process at the front desk to get it. After authenticating and obtaining the keycard, you can only access the places and things the hotel has authorized you to use.</p>

<figure id="fig_authn_hotel_key_card">
  <img src="images/hotel-key-card.jpg" alt=""/>
  <figcaption>OAuth is like a hotel key card, but for apps!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To break it down simply, OAuth is where:</p>

<ol>
<li>App requests authorization from User</li>
<li>User authorizes App and delivers proof of authorization</li>
<li>App presents proof of authorization to the authorization server to get a Token</li>
<li>The Token is restricted to only access what the User authorized for the specific App</li>
<li>Resources (APIs) validate the Token as having the proper and expected authorizations</li>
</ol>

<p>Client applications can be public or confidential. There is a significant distinction between the two in OAuth nomenclature. Confidential clients can be trusted to store a secret because they have backend storage unavailable to review or attack. They’re not running on a desktop or distributed through an app store. People can’t reverse engineer them and get the secret key. They’re running in a protected area where end users can’t access them.</p>

<p>Public clients are browsers, mobile apps, and IoT devices. The code on these devices can be extracted, decompiled, and reviewed. Therefore, we can’t store any sensitive information in the application itself and expect it to be protected. Do not embed a password or secret information - including URLs - of any form in these types of applications!</p>

  <figcaption>Public vs confidential clients</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core OAuth specification describes two types of tokens: an access token and a refresh token. The client uses the access token to access an API (aka Resource Server). They’re meant to be short-lived and work over a span of minutes or hours, not days or months. Due to this, the core OAuth specification doesn’t have an approach to revoking access tokens but in many cases you will need to as a token could have been compromised or a subscription has expired. To address that <a href="https://oauth.net/2/token-revocation/">RFC 7009</a> describes an additional endpoint to revoke a token. To be specific, this revokes it with the Authorization Server, not the Resource Server (API). Unless the Resource Server checks with the Authorization Server, it will not know the token has been revoked. This happens in the real world where you could still use your driver license to board a flight, even if it has been revoked.</p>

<p>The other token is the refresh token. This is much longer-lived and may last for days, months, or years. This token is used exclusively to get a new access token. Because a refresh token effectively persists access long term, getting them requires a confidential clients and they can be revoked more easily.</p>

<p>Next, the OAuth spec doesn’t define how a token is structured, its contents, or how it’s encoded. It can be anything you want but generally you’ll want a JSON Web Token (JWT) as defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a> In a nutshell, a JWT (pronounced “jot”) is a secure and trustworthy standard for token authentication. JWTs allow you to digitally sign information (referred to as claims) with a signature and can be verified at a later time with a public/private key pair.</p>

<p>Tokens are retrieved from endpoints on an authorization server. The two main endpoints are the authorization endpoint and the token endpoint. They’re separated for different use cases.</p>

<p>The authorization endpoint is where the app goes to get authorization and consent from the user. This returns an authorization code that says the user has consented to the app’s request. Then the authorization code is passed to the token endpoint which processes the request and says “great, here’s your access token and your refresh token.”</p>

<p>Now you use the access token to make requests to the API. Once it expires, you use the refresh token with the token endpoint to get a new access and refresh tokens.</p>

<p>Because these tokens can be short-lived and scale out, they can’t be revoked; you have to wait for them to time out.</p>

<p>OAuth uses two channels: a front channel and a back channel. The front channel is what goes over the browser. The back channel is a secure HTTP call directly from the client application to the resource server, such as the request to exchange the authorization code for tokens. These channels are used for different flows depending on what device capabilities you have.</p>

<p>To address the differences between web apps, mobile clients, IoT devices, and even other APIs, there are numerous OAuth grant types or flows. The first four are defined in the core specification while the other three come from extensions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implicit Flow</strong> - everything happens in the browser, on the front channel. Common in single page applications (SPAs).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authorization Code Flow</strong> - the front channel is used to get an authorization code. The back channel is used by the client application to exchange the authorization code for an access token (and optionally a refresh token). This is the gold standard of OAuth flows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Client Credentials Flow</strong> - often used for server-to-server and service account scenarios. It’s a back channel only flow to obtain an access token using the client’s credentials. It differs from most of the other flows in that there is no user involved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Owner Password Flow</strong> - a legacy flow that allows you to pass a username and password to the authorization server. Only recommended when you have old-school clients to accommodate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assertion Flow</strong> - similar to the Client Credentials flow. This was added to open up the idea of federation. This flow allows an Authorization Server to trust authorization grants from third parties such as SAML IdP. The Authorization Server trusts the Identity Provider. This is described further in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7521">RFC 7521</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device Flow</strong> - often used with TVs, command line interfaces, and other devices without a web browser or with limited input options. The device first obtains a short “user code” from the authorization server, and the device prompts the user to enter that code on a separate device such as their mobile phone or computer. The client polls the authorization server via a back channel an access token, and optionally a refresh token is returned after the user authorizes the request. This is described further in the <a href="https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/">OAuth Device Flow draft spec</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authorization Code Flow + PKCE</strong> - the recommended flow for native apps on mobile devices. In this flow, the native app sends a PKCE code challenge along with the authentication request. This is described further in what’s commonly known as the “<a href="https://oauth.net/2/native-apps/">AppAuth spec</a>”.</p></li>
</ol>

  <figcaption>Authorization Framework: Return of complexity through extensions</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There’s a huge number of additions that happened to OAuth in the last several years. These add complexity back on top of OAuth to complete a variety of enterprise scenarios. In <a href="#fig_authn_framework" class="figref"></a>, you can see how JSON and OAuth are the foundation. JWT, JWK, JWE, and JWS can be used as interoperable tokens that can be signed and encrypted.</p>

<h3>Common Misconceptions about OAuth 2.0</h3>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol. It explicitly says so in <a href="https://oauth.net/articles/authentication/">its documentation</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig_authn_oauth_not_authn">
  <img src="images/oauth-not-authn.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>OAuth is not an authentication protocol (oauth.net)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While it’s easy to lose that distinction, note that everything so far has been about delegated authorization. OAuth 2.0 alone says absolutely nothing about the user such as how they authenticate or what information we have about them. We simply have a token to access a resource.
Pseudo-Authentication with OAuth 2.0
Login with OAuth was made famous by Facebook Connect and Twitter. In this flow, a client accesses a <code>/me</code> endpoint with an access token. People invented this endpoint as a way of getting back a user profile with an access token. It’s a non-standard way to get information about the user. There’s no specification to support this and in fact, it was a originally a misuse of the standard networks. Access tokens are meant to be opaque. They’re meant for the API; they’re not designed to contain user information.</p>

<p>What you’re really trying to answer with authentication is <em>who</em> the user is, <em>when</em> did the user authenticate, and <em>how</em> did the user authenticate. You can answer typically answer these questions with SAML assertions, not with access tokens and authorization grants. That’s why it’s called this pseudo authentication.</p>

<h3>OpenID Connect (OIDC)</h3>

<p>To solve the pseudo authentication problem, a number of social and identity providers combined best parts of OAuth 2.0, Facebook Connect, and SAML 2.0 to create <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> or OIDC.</p>

<p>Once again, despite the very similar name, OpenID Connect is not based on or compatible with the original OpenID specification. The name comes from the OpenID Foundation which promotes, protects, and nurtures the technologies and communities involved in identity on the web.</p>

<p>At a technical level, OIDC extends OAuth 2.0 with a new token called the  <code>id_token</code> on the client application side and the UserInfo endpoint on the server side. They both benefit from having a specific, limited set of scopes and well-defined set of user-related claims. By combining them, an application can request information on a user’s profile, email, address, and even phone number in a consistent way regardless of the OIDC provider.</p>

<p>OIDC was made famous by Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, all big early adopters. The single most important part is that the consistent scopes and claims make implementations fast, easier, and compatible regardless of the provider.</p>

<div class="break-before"></div>

<p>Generally, an OpenID Connect flow involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discover OIDC metadata as <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">defined in the specification</a></li>
<li>Perform the OAuth flow to obtain id token and access token</li>
<li>Validate JWT ID token locally based on built-in dates and signature</li>
<li>Get additional user attributes as needed with the access token at the UserInfo endpoint</li>
</ol>

<p>In terms of implementation, an ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) which adheres to the specification and is small enough to pass between devices</p>

<figure id="fig_authn_oidc">
  <img src="images/openid-connect.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>OpenID Connect Flow</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Authorization Code Flow can also be used with Native apps. In this scenario, the native app sends a PKCE code challenge along with the authentication request. PKCE (pronounced “pixy”) stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange and is defined by <a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/">RFC 7636</a>.</p>

<p>OIDC is an excellent addition to and special case of OAuth because it allows you to get a user’s information and learn more about them.</p>

<h2 id="authn-best-practices">Recommended Best Practices for Authentication</h2>

<p>Using industry standard authentication protocols will help you secure your API in well-understood, predictable, and scalable ways that allow your team to use established services, components, and libraries while not confusing end users.</p>

<p>If you're building an API for server-side clients, you essentially have three choices when implementing authentication:</p>

<p><strong>HTTP Basic Authentication:</strong> This is the simplest option, but doesn't provide the security and key rotation benefits of OAuth Client Credentials.</p>

<p><strong>Digest Authentication:</strong> This is what many large providers use with various customizations, most famously, Amazon. Unless you have a very pressing security need, I recommend you not use Digest Authentication as it requires a lot of engineering work to implement and maintain, and shifts the security burden to you.</p>

<p><strong>OAuth Client Credentials:</strong> This is the only OAuth flow designed for server-side clients to use. The client will exchange their ID and secret for a token. If you're building an API and want to reduce security risk over the network, using OAuth Client Credentials is a good option.</p>

<p>If you're building an API for a mobile client, you should always use the OIDC Authorization Code flow with PKCE (as explained in the OpenID Connect section above).</p>

<p>If you're building an API for a web app with a server-side backend, you should always use the OIDC Authorization Code flow.</p>

<p>If you're building an API for single-page app (e.g. a React app) that has no server-side backend, then the only type of authentication you can use is the OIDC Implicit flow as described earlier.</p>

<p>By following these guidelines and using the correct form of authentication for the correct type of API, you can feel confident in your implementation and give your users a sense of security, regardless of what type of app client is being used.</p>
